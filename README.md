### Personal Resume Website

For the final website demo, please visit [Ashish Kushwaha Profile](http://ashishkushwaha.github.io/)

Single Page Website (showcasing my skills & work exp) based on several open source CSS/JavaScript frameworks. This website is based on the Google Material Design scheme. But unlike most material design website out there, this one has a "Dark Theme".

Feel free to use the files for creating your own personal/project website.
